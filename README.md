We used to hols bi-weekly community meetings. But due to timezone issues, currently we publish a written update every 4-6 weeks. For feature requests and bug reports or feedbacks, please file an issue in this GitHub repo. You can also talk to our dev team via Slack. If you are interested in purchasing commercial support, please setup a meeting via https://calendly.com/appscode/30min .
