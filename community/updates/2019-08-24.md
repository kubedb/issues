# KubeDB Work Progress Report

## August 2019

### Completed Tasks

- [[MongoDB] MongoDB SSL Support](https://github.com/kubedb/project/issues/352): MongoDB now supports all available [ClusterAuthMode](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-mongod-clusterauthmode) (i.e., `keyFile`, `sendKeyFile`, `sendX509` and `x509`) and [SSLMode](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-mongod-sslmode) (i.e., `disabled`, `allowSSL`, `preferSSL` and `requireSSL`). Default ClusterAuthMode will be `x509` if `sslmode` is not `disabled`. 

- [Analysis and Implement PodDisruptionBudget Policies ](https://github.com/kubedb/project/issues/460): Analyzed implemented PodDisruptionBudget to help prevent maintenance work from bringing down the entire cluster.

- [Improve Developer Experience](https://github.com/kubedb/elasticsearch/pull/274): Introduced `makefile` to improve the developer experience. Now developers can run:
  - `make push` to build and push the docker images to docker hub.
  - `make install` to install the latest build operator into the Kubernetes cluster. 
  - `make e2e-tests` or `make e2e-parallel` to run e2e tests either sequentially or parallelly.
  - `make uninstall` to uninstall to the operator.
  - `make purge` to uninstall the operator and delete all the crd and crd objects.

- [[MongoDB] Support more mongodb versions](https://github.com/kubedb/mongodb/pull/171): Latest MongoDB versions are added. Pre-SSPL (before October 16, 2018) versions (i.e,`3.4.17`, `3.6.8`, `4.0.3`, `4.1.4`) are also included.

- [Support restic as snapshot uploader](https://github.com/kubedb/project/issues/168): Initial support of restic is added to kubedb. Read about how the backup and restore process works form [here](https://appscode.com/products/stash/v0.9.0-rc.0/guides/latest/databases/overview/). 

- Bug Fixes: Couple of important bug fixes to make the operator more stable.

### Ongoing Tasks

- [Improve restic/stash snapshot support](https://github.com/kubedb/project/issues/168): Improvement of stash/restic support is going on.
  
- [[PgBouncer] PgBouncer Support](https://github.com/kubedb/pgbouncer): We are actively working on PgBouncer support.
  
- [[Percona XtraDB] MySQL Clustering - Percona XtraDB](https://github.com/kubedb/percona-xtradb): After research and analysis, we have implemented Percona xtradb clustering support and We are very close to release its beta version. 

- [[CLI] Implement logical database support](https://github.com/kubedb/project/issues/448): We are going to add it as a CLI plugin. Currently, we are planning and tweaking cli code to achieve some basic usage.
